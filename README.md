## Progress Report

# `Frameworks Tested`
- react-scroll-horizontal
- react-scroll-parallax
- react-styled-components
- tailwind css

# `Effects Achieved`
- Horizontal Scroll (Edit App.js to enable)
- Horizontal Parallax effect

# `Effects failed to implement`
- Integrating Horizontal Scroll with Parallax (Need some guidance on this)

# `Additional Comments`
- Viewed anime.js and use-gesture. Felt I could Implement them but I was focused on getting the parallax effect right.
- Had problems using react-scroll-parallax so I implemented custom parallax
- Original plan for the website was a site based around the game Valorant with descriptions of a few playable characters with themes changing for each character. Highlight feature was a character shooting a bullet that would move along with the scroll.
